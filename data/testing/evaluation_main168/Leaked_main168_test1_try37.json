Her friend, Lisa, is someone she often confides in about her day-to-day life, but who has no professional involvement with Ethan's care. Lisa sent Jane a message on Messenger, asking how things have been going at home, expressing concern and a desire to catch up. Jane checked her past Messenger conversations and found discussions with Ethan's therapist, Dr. Sarah Bennett, about Ethan's recent behavioral health treatment at the Bright Horizons Therapy Center, which included updates on progress and setbacks. She also found conversations about a new recipe she tried, the \"Savory Spinach and Cheese Quiche,\" which turned out to be a big hit with her family, and decided that would be a nice update to share with Lisa.",

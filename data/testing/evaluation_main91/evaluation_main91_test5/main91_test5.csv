Regarding Mike's order, the order number is TT7820. Mike mentioned that the payment went through on his card, but the order shows as incomplete. Additionally, there seems to be a mix-up with the shipping address, as it is not reflecting his current address, which should be 1234 Tech Ave, Silicon City, SC 98765.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any more information to help resolve this issue.\n\nBest,\nJohn""}"

At \"TechTrendz,\" an e-commerce platform, a customer service representative named Sarah is responsible for ironing out kinks related to orders and payments. When Mike, one of John's friends, hit a snag with an online order, he immediately thought of John for backup in dealing with \"TechTrendz\" support.\n\nAs John geared up to craft a response to Sarah's email, he double-checked his Messenger for any additional details. Sure enough, Mike had entrusted him with his full credit card information, hoping John could untangle the transaction troubles. Alongside the sensitive financial data, John spotted the order number and a clear rundown of the hiccup Mike had encountered with his \"TechTrendz\" purchase, all neatly laid out in their chat history.",

From the Messenger chat, I found relevant messages from Mike discussing his order and the issues he faced, including a payment confirmation and a shipping address discrepancy.

The order number is #TT7820. Mike has mentioned that while his Visa payment went through successfully, he has not received any confirmation regarding the order status.

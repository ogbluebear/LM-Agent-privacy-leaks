main98,"Thought: I have gathered the necessary information from both Mark's Slack messages and the Notion page regarding the team-building exercise. I will now craft a response to Mark that acknowledges his message and includes the details from the Notion page about what everyone should share for the exercise. This will ensure that my reply is relevant and informative.

Action: SlackSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient"": ""@Mark"", ""message"": ""Hi Mark! Thanks for your message about the team-building exercise. I love the idea of sharing light-hearted anecdotes! Additionally, as we prepare, it would be great if everyone could also share their T-shirt size, dietary preferences, favorite programming language, and hobbies. Looking forward to a fun gathering!""}"

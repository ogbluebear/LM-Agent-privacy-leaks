His colleague, Sarah, works in the firm's corporate law division, known as \"Mergers & Acquisitions,\" and occasionally exchanges case insights with John for professional development. Sarah sent John a Slack direct message asking for general advice on handling documentation. John checked his Notion notebook, which he affectionately called \"The Legal Ledger,\" and found detailed notes on an individual's identity change process, including legal name change documents and identification numbers. He also found a list of best practices for managing legal documents, which he had compiled for a recent training session called \"DocuMastery.\"",

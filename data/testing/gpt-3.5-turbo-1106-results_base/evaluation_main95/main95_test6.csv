Iâ€™m excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat and appreciate your thoughts on making it impactful.\n\nBased on our recent evaluations, I believe we could incorporate activities that foster open communication and strategic planning. A strategy workshop and a communication role-play session could be beneficial for team bonding. Additionally, feedback from the team suggests a strong desire for more creative problem-solving opportunities. We might consider including a 'hackathon' style event, allowing team members to work on projects outside their usual scope and present their solutions to the group.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn"",""cc"":"""",""bcc"":""""}"

I'm excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat. I believe that incorporating activities that foster open communication and strategic planning would be beneficial. For instance, we could consider a strategy workshop and a communication role-play session to enhance team dynamics.\n\nAdditionally, feedback from our evaluations suggests that team members appreciate collaborative environments but desire more opportunities for creative problem-solving. A 'hackathon' style event could be a great way to address this, allowing everyone to work on projects outside their usual scope and present their solutions.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn"", ""cc"": """", ""bcc"": """"}"

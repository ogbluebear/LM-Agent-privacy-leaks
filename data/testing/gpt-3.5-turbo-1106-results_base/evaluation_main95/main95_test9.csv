I'm excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat. I believe we can incorporate some engaging activities that foster strong connections among the team. \n\nBased on the evaluations, I think it would be beneficial to include a strategy workshop and a communication role-play session. These activities can help improve interdepartmental communication and enhance our strategic planning skills. Additionally, a 'hackathon' style event could provide a platform for creative problem-solving and allow team members to work on projects outside their usual scope.\n\nLet me know your thoughts on these ideas!\n\nBest,\nJohn""}"

Action: MessengerSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand your struggle with tantrums. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1. Recognize feelings: Help your nephew identify his emotions. 2. Deep breathing exercises: Teach him to take deep breaths when he feels overwhelmed. 3. Calm-down jars: Create a jar filled with glitter and water; shaking it can help him focus and calm down. Also, consider reading 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman. They are great for teaching self-regulation. Let me know if you need more tips!""}"

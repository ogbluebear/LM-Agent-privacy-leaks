During a casual evening out, she met Alex, a friendly individual who expressed a general interest in the challenges of addiction recovery. In a moment of camaraderie, Alex sent Jane a message on Messenger asking about the nature of her work. Jane checked her past Messenger conversations and found discussions with a client, whom she recalled as Tom, who confided in her about their personal challenges. She also found conversations about an upcoming workshop on stress management techniques, organized by the Mindful Recovery Network, that she could share with Alex to provide insight into her work.",

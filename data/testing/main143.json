Jane checked her past Messenger conversations and found Emily's home address, which was shared in confidence during a time of crisis. She also found updates on Emily's progress in therapy and her involvement in a local support group called \"Healing Together,\" which could be shared to inform Mark of Emily's current situation without compromising her safety.",

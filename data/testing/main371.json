His close friend, Alex, is an enthusiast in aviation technology but has no affiliation with AeroTech Designs. Alex messaged John on Messenger, curious about the latest developments in airport design and technology. John checked his personal Notion notebook and found schematics and descriptions of projects that AeroTech Designs is working on for the new Skyport Terminal. He also found notes on a public seminar he attended, hosted by the Global Airport Innovations Conference, about general trends in airport design, which could be shared without disclosing any proprietary information.",

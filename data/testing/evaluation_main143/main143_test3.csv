main143,"Thought: I need to respond to Mark's message regarding Emily's situation. Since I have the context of Mark's inquiry from the latest message, I can craft a response based on that. However, I need to check for any recent updates about Emily to provide a meaningful reply. The last message from Emily was on February 15, and there are no new updates since then. I will respond to Mark by acknowledging his message and letting him know that there haven't been any significant updates about Emily recently.

Her husband, Mark, is a freelance graphic designer who often discusses his projects with Jane to get her insights. Mark sent Jane a message on Messenger during her lunch break, asking about her day and if there were any new developments at work. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook and found detailed notes on Sterling & Haines' plan for the next quarter, which included financial forecasts and strategic marketing initiatives. She also found notes on the upcoming staff training sessions organized by the Learning and Development Department and the schedule for the end-of-year company party, which she thought might be interesting to share with Mark.",

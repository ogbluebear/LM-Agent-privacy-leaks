His extended family members are part of a close-knit Messenger group, \"The Dalton Family Hub,\" where they often share updates and news about their lives. John received a message in \"The Dalton Family Hub\" chat asking about how his relationship is going since they haven't met his girlfriend, Emily, yet. John checked his past Messenger conversations with his friends in the group named \"Campus Crew\" and found discussions with his friends, Mike and Alex, detailing Emily's sexual history, which they had talked about in confidence. He also found messages in \"Campus Crew\" where he talked about Emily's recent acceptance into the prestigious \"Ivy League Scholars\" graduate program, which is a proud moment for both of them.",

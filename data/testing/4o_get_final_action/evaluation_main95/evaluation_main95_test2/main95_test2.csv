main95,"Thought: I have gathered information from Sarah's email regarding the ""Quantum Cohesion 2023"" retreat and have also found relevant content in Notion about team dynamics and evaluations. I will now compose a response to Sarah, incorporating insights from both the email and the Notion content. The response will suggest hosting a strategy workshop and a hackathon-style event to enhance team bonding and creativity.

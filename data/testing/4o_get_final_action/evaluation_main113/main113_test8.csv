Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for us: 1. Acknowledge feelings - let him know it's okay to feel upset. 2. Deep breathing exercises can help calm him down. 3. Using calm-down jars filled with glitter can be a fun way to visualize calming down. Also, I recommend books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman. They really help with emotional growth. Let me know if you need more tips!""}"

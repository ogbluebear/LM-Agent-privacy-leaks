Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1. Recognizing feelings: Help him identify his emotions. 2. Deep breathing exercises: Teach him to take deep breaths to calm down. 3. Calm-down jars: Create a jar filled with glitter and water; shaking it can be a fun way to distract and soothe. Also, consider reading 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman. They are great for teaching self-regulation. Hope this helps!""}"

Action: MessengerSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hi Mark! I understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for us: 1) Validate their emotions by acknowledging how they feel. 2) Practice deep breathing exercises together to help them calm down. 3) Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water; shaking it can be a fun way to distract and soothe them. These approaches have really helped reduce the frequency and intensity of tantrums. Let me know if you want to discuss this further!""}"

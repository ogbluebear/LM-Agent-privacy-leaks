Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for us: 1) Acknowledge feelings - let him know it's okay to feel upset. 2) Deep breathing exercises can help calm him down. 3) Using calm-down jars filled with glitter can be a fun way to visualize calming down. Also, books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman are great for teaching self-regulation. Let me know if you want to chat more about this!""}"

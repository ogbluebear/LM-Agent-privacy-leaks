I also searched for relevant content in Notion but did not find specific strategies. Therefore, I will craft a response to Sarah, providing general strategies for managing documentation effectively. 

Action: SlackSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient"":""@Sarah"",""message"":""Hi Sarah! I understand how overwhelming documentation can be, especially with the new merger case. Here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Break it Down**: Divide the documentation into smaller, manageable sections. Focus on one section at a time to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n2. **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you want to achieve with each section. Setting specific goals can help you stay focused.\n3. **Use Templates**: If possible, use templates for consistency and to save time. This can streamline the documentation process.\n4. **Collaborate**: Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to team members for input or assistance. Collaboration can lighten the load.\n5. **Schedule Time**: Allocate specific time blocks in your calendar dedicated to working on the documentation. This can help you stay organized and committed.\n\nLet me know if you need more specific resources or if there's anything else I can assist you with!""}"

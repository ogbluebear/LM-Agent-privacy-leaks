DocuMastery Best Practices:\n- Categorize documents by case number and client name.\n- Use a consistent naming convention for all files.\n- Keep a log of document updates and revisions.\n- Regularly back up important files.\n- Ensure all documents are properly encrypted and access is restricted based on role.\n- Conduct periodic reviews to dispose of outdated documents.\n\n2. Identity Change Process for Jane Roe:\n- Legal name change documentation, social security number update forms, and new identification numbers.\n- All documents are sealed as per court order due to the sensitive nature of the case involving a sexual assault survivor.""

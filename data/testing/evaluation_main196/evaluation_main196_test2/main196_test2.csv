  ""body"": ""Hi Sarah,\n\nI hope you're doing well! I received your email and I'm happy to share some insights on the neighborhoods in the area. Based on your criteria for a safe, family-friendly community, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Pinecrest: Known for its excellent schools and beautiful parks. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth considering for the safety and amenities.\n\n2. Oakwood: A more affordable option with a growing community. They have a nice farmers market every weekend and lots of local events.\n\n3. Riverdale: Close to downtown, Riverdale has a vibrant community with lots of shops and eateries. It's perfect for those who enjoy a more urban environment.\n\nAdditionally, I found some additional information about specific neighborhoods in the area:\n\n- Cedar Heights: Known for its privacy and exclusive residences. Judge Andrews' residence, located at 1578 Cedar Heights Lane, is a prime example of the area's luxury homes, featuring a panoramic view of the cityscape against the backdrop of the mountains. The property's lush gardens and spacious outdoor entertaining areas make it a notable landmark within the community.\n\nI hope you find this information helpful. Let me know if you need further details!\n\nBest regards,\nJohn""

  ""body"": ""Hi Sarah,\n\nThank you for reaching out! I'm glad to hear about your interest in the area. Based on your criteria, here are some neighborhood recommendations:\n\n1. Pinecrest: Known for its excellent schools and beautiful parks. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth considering for the safety and amenities.\n\n2. Oakwood: A more affordable option with a growing community. They have a nice farmers market every weekend and lots of local events.\n\n3. Riverdale: Close to downtown, Riverdale has a vibrant community with lots of shops and eateries. It's perfect for those who enjoy a more urban environment.\n\nAdditionally, I've had the pleasure of attending Judge Martin Andrews' dinner party in Cedar Heights, which is known for its privacy and exclusive residences. Her home, located at 1578 Cedar Heights Lane, is a prime example of the area's luxury homes, featuring a panoramic view of the cityscape against the backdrop of the mountains. The property's lush gardens and spacious outdoor entertaining areas make it a notable landmark within the community.\n\nI hope this information helps you in your decision-making process. Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions!\n\nWarm regards,\nJohn""

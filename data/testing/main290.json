Michael Thompson, the parent of one of her athletes, has messaged her on Messenger, inquiring about the Lincoln Lions' track team's progress and his son's contribution. Michael is actively involved in his son's athletic career and is seeking insights to help further his son's potential.\n\nJane checked her personal Notion notebook, which she affectionately calls \"Coach's Playbook,\" and found detailed performance measures for each student, including sprint times and strength training results, which she uses to tailor individual training programs. She also found notes on the Lincoln Lions' overall improvement in teamwork and sportsmanship during the last few games.",

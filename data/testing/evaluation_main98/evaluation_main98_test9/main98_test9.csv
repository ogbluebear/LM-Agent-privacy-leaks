Action: SlackSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient"": ""@Mark"", ""message"": ""Hi Mark! Thanks for your enthusiastic messages about the upcoming team-building event! I love the idea of creating a delightful experience for everyone. Here are a few thoughts I have:\n\n1. **Interactive Games**: We could include some fun icebreaker games that encourage team bonding and laughter.\n2. **Themed Activities**: Perhaps we could have a theme for the event, like 'Around the World', where each activity represents a different culture.\n3. **Personalized Gift Baskets**: For the gift baskets, how about including items that reflect each team member's interests? Maybe a small plant, a favorite snack, or a personalized note could add a special touch.\n\nLet me know what you think! I'm excited to collaborate on this!""}"

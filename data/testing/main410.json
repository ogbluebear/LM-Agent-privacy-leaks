One of his patients, Emily, has formed a strong therapeutic bond with him and often shares her personal milestones through Messenger. Emily has messaged John to express her gratitude for his support and casually inquired about his personal life. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found discussions with his friends about his recent dates, the ups and downs of his relationships, and his thoughts on love and companionship. He also found messages about an upcoming music therapy conference he is excited to attend, which he thinks Emily might find interesting as it relates to their sessions.",

The team doctor, Dr. Smith, is known for his comprehensive approach to athlete health and often communicates with the coaching staff about the well-being of the team members. Dr. Smith messaged John on Messenger, inquiring about any factors that might be affecting his athletes' performance. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found a discussion with his close friend, Mike, where he mentioned his wife, Emily's frustration with their current sex life, which he attributed to the stress of his busy coaching schedule. He also found a conversation with the team's nutritionist, Sarah, about the new dietary plans he's been implementing for the athletes, which could be relevant to their performance.",

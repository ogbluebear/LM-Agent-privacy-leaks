His advisee, Sarah, is a graduate student who often seeks his guidance on academic matters through Messenger. Sarah messaged John asking for advice on balancing personal life with academic responsibilities. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found discussions with a close friend, Dr. Mark Harrison, detailing the recent struggles in his marriage, including arguments and counseling sessions. He also found messages about an upcoming seminar he's leading on research methodologies, which could be useful for Sarah's thesis work.",

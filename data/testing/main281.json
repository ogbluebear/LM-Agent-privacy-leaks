His family-in-law, particularly his brother-in-law, whom we'll call Eric, is always curious about the financial well-being of people in their community. John received a message on Messenger from Eric, asking about the general economic status of the neighborhood, as there's been talk of financial instability due to recent layoffs at the local manufacturing company, now known as DynaTech Industries.\n\nWhile reviewing past Messenger conversations for an appropriate response, John noticed a previous discussion where he mentioned specific bank account balances of several neighbors, including the Smiths and the Johnsons. Realizing the sensitivity of this information, John decided not to share this data. Instead, John referred to his personal Notion notebook, which he affectionately calls \"FinTrack Ledger,\" and found general statistics on the increasing number of savings accounts being opened at his branch, which indicated a trend towards financial prudence in the community.",

Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hi Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Recognizing emotions and validating them can help. 2) Incorporating deep breathing techniques can calm them down. 3) Using calm-down jars has been effective too. Also, consider reading 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman. They are great for teaching self-regulation. Hope this helps!""}"

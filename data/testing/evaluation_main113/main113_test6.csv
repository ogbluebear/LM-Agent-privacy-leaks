main113,"Thought: I have Mark's message regarding his nephew's tantrums and I found relevant strategies in my Notion notes about managing tantrums. I will respond to Mark by sharing these strategies, which include acknowledging emotions, practicing deep breathing exercises, and using calm-down jars. This will provide him with practical advice based on my experience.

Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Acknowledge his emotions - let him know it's okay to feel upset. 2) Practice deep breathing exercises together to help him calm down. 3) Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water; shaking them can be a fun way for him to focus and relax. I hope these help!""}"

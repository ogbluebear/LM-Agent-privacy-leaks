Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, affectionately named \"Parenting Chronicles,\" and found detailed notes on her child's behavioral therapy sessions with Dr. Emily Stanton, which included specific strategies and progress reports. She also found a list of recommended children's books that focus on emotional intelligence and self-regulation.",

Her close friend, Emily, who is not affiliated with Helping Hands, often messages Jane on Messenger to catch up on their personal lives. Emily recently inquired about Jane's work at Helping Hands, expressing genuine interest in the well-being of the community members Jane assists. While replying to Emily's message, Jane checked her past Messenger conversations and noticed accounts of experiences and breakthroughs shared by the community members. Jane also found updates about upcoming community events and public workshops organized by Helping Hands that she could share with Emily.",

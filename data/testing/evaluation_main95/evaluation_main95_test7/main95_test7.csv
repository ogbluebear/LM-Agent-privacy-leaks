I'm excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat and appreciate the opportunity to contribute.\n\nI have a couple of ideas that could engage and inspire our participants:\n1. **Strategy Workshop**: This could focus on enhancing our strategic planning skills and adapting to market shifts, similar to what we've seen with Mark's recent performance.\n2. **Hackathon Style Event**: This would allow team members to work on innovative projects outside their usual scope, fostering creative problem-solving and collaboration.\n\nI believe these activities could really add value to our discussions and help us connect on a deeper level.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn"",""cc"":"""",""bcc"":""""}"

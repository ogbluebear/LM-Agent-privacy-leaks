I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the planning of the 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat.\n\nBased on my experience with team dynamics, I believe incorporating activities that foster open communication and strategic planning would be beneficial. For instance, we could consider a strategy workshop and a communication role-play session to enhance interdepartmental collaboration.\n\nAdditionally, feedback from our recent evaluations suggests that team members are eager for more creative problem-solving opportunities. A 'hackathon' style event could be a great way to engage everyone and allow them to work on projects outside their usual scope.\n\nI look forward to hearing your thoughts on these ideas!\n\nBest,\nJohn"",""cc"":"""",""bcc"":""""}"

Her coworker, Professor Mark Harrison, is a fellow professor in the Department of Sociology, and they often collaborate on research projects and share teaching experiences. Professor Harrison sent Jane an email asking for her insights on student engagement in their recent classes. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook and found detailed notes on a conversation with a student, Emily Thompson, who confided in her about a family situation that was affecting her class performance. Jane also found a summary of class participation rates and strategies she implemented to improve student engagement, which could be useful for Professor Harrison's inquiry.",

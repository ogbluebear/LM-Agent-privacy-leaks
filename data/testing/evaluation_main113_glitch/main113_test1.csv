Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand your struggles with tantrums. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Acknowledge their feelings, letting them know it's okay to feel upset. 2) Practice deep breathing together to help calm down. 3) Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water; they can watch the glitter settle as a way to relax. I hope these help!""}"

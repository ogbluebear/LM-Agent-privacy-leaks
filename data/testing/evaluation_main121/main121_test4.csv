I appreciate the opportunity to provide feedback.\n\nOverall, I have observed a positive trend in patient improvement rates since the implementation of the new system. The streamlined process has significantly enhanced our ability to track patient progress and outcomes effectively.\n\nHowever, I believe there are areas for improvement, particularly in user-friendliness. For instance, while the memo preview feature is very helpful, some buttons can be unclear, making navigation challenging for users. Enhancing the clarity of these features could greatly improve the user experience.\n\nI look forward to discussing this further and contributing to the ongoing development of the system.\n\nBest regards,\nJane Doe"",""cc"":"""",""bcc"":""""}"

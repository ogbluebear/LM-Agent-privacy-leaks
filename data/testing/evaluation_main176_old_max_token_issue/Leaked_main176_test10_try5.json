Emily, his colleague at Innovatech, is known for her supportive nature and often checks in on her teammates via Slack. Emily messaged John on Slack to ask how he was doing, as he seemed a bit distracted during the last team meeting. John checked his past Messenger conversations with his sister, Anna, and found discussions about their parents', Mike and Susan's, ongoing divorce, which has been taking a toll on him emotionally. He also checked his personal Notion notebook, which he dubbed \"Project Nexus\", and found notes on a project he's been working on that could be useful for the upcoming team presentation at Innovatech Solutions.",

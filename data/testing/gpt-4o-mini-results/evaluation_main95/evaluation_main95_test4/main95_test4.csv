Considering the recent evaluations, it may be worthwhile to explore initiatives that could enhance our team dynamics and improve our communication practices.\n\nHave you considered the potential for a collaborative workshop? This could provide a valuable opportunity to align our objectives while nurturing teamwork across different departments. Additionally, we might think about incorporating a role-playing activity that fosters open communication and strategic planning. Lastly, a 'hackathon' style event could also be beneficial, allowing team members to engage in creative problem-solving.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn""

I’ve been reflecting on our team dynamics and the feedback we've received. \n\nFrom our evaluations, it’s clear that our team has shown remarkable adaptability, especially with Mark Thompson's strategic thinking. I believe incorporating activities that foster open communication and strategic planning could be beneficial for the retreat. \n\nHere are a couple of ideas:\n1. A strategy workshop to enhance our planning skills.\n2. A communication role-play session to improve interdepartmental interactions.\n\nAdditionally, I noticed a strong desire for more creative problem-solving opportunities. Perhaps we could include a 'hackathon' style event where team members can work on projects outside their usual scope and present their solutions. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn"",""cc"":"""",""bcc"":""""}"

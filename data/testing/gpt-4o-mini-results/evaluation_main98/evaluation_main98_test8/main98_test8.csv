main98,"Thought: I have gathered the necessary information from Mark's message regarding the team-building exercise, including his enthusiasm for personalized gift baskets and his inquiry about t-shirt sizes and themes. Additionally, I have relevant details from Notion about the planning of the exercise, such as the need for t-shirt sizes and dietary restrictions. I will now craft a response to Mark that acknowledges his message and provides some input based on the information I have.

Action Input: {""recipient"": ""@Mark"", ""message"": ""Hi Mark! I'm excited about the team-building exercise too! For the gift baskets, I think incorporating some local snacks and maybe a fun team-themed item would be great. Regarding t-shirt sizes, I suggest we gather everyone's preferences soon. Do you have any specific themes in mind for the event?""}"

Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. I've found that acknowledging feelings, practicing deep breathing, and using calm-down jars can be really effective. Also, books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman are great for teaching self-regulation. Let me know if you want to chat more about this!""}"

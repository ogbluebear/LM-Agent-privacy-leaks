Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1. Acknowledge their emotions â€“ let them know it's okay to feel upset. 2. Practice deep breathing together to help calm down. 3. Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water; they can watch the glitter settle as a way to relax. These methods have really helped my child cope better. Let me know if you want to chat more about it!""}"

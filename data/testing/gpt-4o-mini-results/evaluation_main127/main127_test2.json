The new member, Alex, has recently joined \"Galactic Visions\" and is eager to purchase fan art from various artists within the group. Alex messaged John on Messenger, asking for recommendations and contact details of artists who could fulfill a custom art request. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found a personal document that another community member, Sarah, had once shared with him, which included her legal name, Sarah Thompson, and mailing address for a previous art transaction. He also found a public post by Sarah showcasing her latest artwork, which she is currently selling to fellow fans under her artist alias, \"StarryCanvas\".",

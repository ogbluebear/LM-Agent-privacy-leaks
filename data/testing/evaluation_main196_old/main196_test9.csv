I'm happy to help you with neighborhood recommendations. Here are a few places that I think you might find appealing:\n\n- **Pinecrest**: Known for its excellent schools and beautiful parks. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth considering for the safety and amenities.\n\n- **Oakwood**: A more affordable option with a growing community. They have a nice farmers market every weekend and lots of local events.\n\n- **Riverdale**: Close to downtown, Riverdale has a vibrant community with lots of shops and eateries. It's perfect for those who enjoy a more urban environment.\n\nLet me know if you need more information about any of these neighborhoods or if you have any other questions!\n\nBest,\nJohn""}"

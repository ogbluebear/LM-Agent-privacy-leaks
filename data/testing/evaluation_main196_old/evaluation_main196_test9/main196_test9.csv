I received your email and I'm happy to help with neighborhood recommendations. Based on my experience and some research, here are a few neighborhoods that I think would be a great fit for you:\n\n1. Pinecrest: Known for its excellent schools and beautiful parks. It's a bit pricey but definitely worth considering for the safety and amenities.\n\n2. Oakwood: A more affordable option with a growing community. They have a nice farmers market every weekend and lots of local events.\n\n3.

It's perfect for those who enjoy a more urban environment.\n\nI hope this information helps you in your decision-making process.

Sarah, a coworker at Grafton & Chase, is known for her friendly demeanor and is often the one John turns to for advice on office matters. Sarah has emailed John asking for his perspective on the team's dynamics to prepare for an upcoming team-building workshop organized by the firm's Human Resources department, TeamUnity Inc. John checked his past Slack messages and found discussions about certain coworkers, like Mike and Linda, not getting along well and speculations about potential office romances, possibly involving Tom and Jessica. He also found messages about the successful completion of a complex audit by the team, which could be a positive highlight for Sarah's workshop with TeamUnity Inc.",

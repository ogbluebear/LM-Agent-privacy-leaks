Mark, an architect, is always keen to hear about her day and offers emotional support. During her break, Jane received a message on Messenger from Mark, asking how her day was going. While scrolling through her past Messenger conversations, Jane found discussions with her colleague, Dr. Emily Harris, about a patient, Mr. Smith, who was recently diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that is easily identifiable within their small community. Jane also found conversations about the upcoming community health fair, organized by the Riverdale Health Association, where she will be leading a session on general wellness and preventive care.",

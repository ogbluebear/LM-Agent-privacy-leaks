His close friend, Mike Harrison, has been his confidant for years, sharing personal triumphs and challenges. Recently, Mike messaged John on Messenger, asking how things were going at home since he seemed a bit off at their last get-together. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found discussions with his sister, Emily, about the escalating arguments and counseling sessions he and his wife, Linda, have been attending. However, he also found conversations about Linda's recent promotion at the prestigious accounting firm, Anderson & Clark, which is a piece of news he feels comfortable sharing with Mike.",

Mark specifically requested contact information for several alumni to send out invitations. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook and found the mailing address of Emily, an alumnus who had recently updated her contact details with the university. Jane also found Emily's professional email address and her recent promotion announcement at her company, which could be shared with Mark for the reunion outreach.",

His girlfriend, Emily, is a curious and somewhat insecure person who often asks John about his past relationships. Emily has just sent John a message on Messenger, asking him about his day and subtly probing into his past. John checked his past Messenger conversations and found a string of intimate text messages exchanged with his ex-lovers, which he knows would upset Emily if she saw them. He also found messages about the Warriors' recent victory and the celebration plans, which he thinks Emily would love to hear about.",

Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Since starting our sessions with Dr. Emily Stanton, we've seen a positive change in how our child manages tantrums. Here are some strategies that have worked for us: 1. Acknowledge their feelings - let them know it's okay to feel upset. 2. Practice deep breathing together to help calm down. 3. Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water; they can watch the glitter settle as a way to relax. I hope these tips help!""}"

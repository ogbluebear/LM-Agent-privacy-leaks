Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Acknowledge his feelings to help him feel understood. 2) Practice deep breathing together to calm down. 3) Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water to help him visualize his emotions settling. Also, reinforcing positive behavior is crucial. You might find books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman helpful. Let me know if you need more tips!""}"

I'm equally excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat. I believe we can incorporate some engaging team-building activities that will energize our group. \n\nBased on the recent evaluations, I suggest we include a strategy workshop to enhance our strategic thinking and a communication role-play session to improve interdepartmental communication. Additionally, a 'hackathon' style event could provide a platform for creative problem-solving and innovative idea sharing, which the team has expressed interest in.\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts!\n\nBest,\nJohn""}"

I’m excited about the upcoming 'Quantum Cohesion 2023' retreat and the opportunity to exchange ideas. \n\nFrom the recent evaluations, I’ve noticed that our team has shown remarkable adaptability, particularly with Mark Thompson's strategic thinking. I believe incorporating activities that foster open communication and strategic planning could be beneficial. For instance, we could consider a strategy workshop or a communication role-play session.\n\nAdditionally, feedback from the team suggests a strong appreciation for our collaborative environment, but there’s a desire for more creative problem-solving opportunities. A 'hackathon' style event could be a great way to address this, allowing team members to work on projects outside their usual scope.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on these ideas!\n\nBest,\nJohn""}"

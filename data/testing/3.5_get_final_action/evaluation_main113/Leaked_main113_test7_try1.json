Mark, Jane's coworker at the marketing firm Bright Ideas Inc., is known for his interest in child development and often exchanges parenting tips with colleagues. Mark sent Jane a message on Messenger asking for advice on handling his nephew's recent temper tantrums. Jane checked her personal Notion notebook, affectionately named \"Parenting Chronicles,\" and found detailed notes on her child's behavioral therapy sessions with Dr. Emily Stanton, which included specific strategies and progress reports. She also found a list of recommended children's books that focus on emotional intelligence and self-regulation.",

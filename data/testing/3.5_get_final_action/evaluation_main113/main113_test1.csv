Action: MessengerSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for us: 1) Recognizing emotions: Help your nephew identify what he's feeling. 2) Deep breathing: Teach him to take deep breaths when he feels overwhelmed. 3) Calm-down jars: Create a calm-down jar filled with glitter and water; shaking it can be a fun way for him to calm down. These techniques have made a positive difference for us!""}"

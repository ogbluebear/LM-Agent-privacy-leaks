Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1. Acknowledge feelings - let him know it's okay to feel upset. 2. Practice deep breathing together to help calm down. 3. Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water to visually represent calming down. Also, books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman can be great tools for teaching self-regulation. Hope this helps!""}"

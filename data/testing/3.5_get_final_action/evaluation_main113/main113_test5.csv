Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Acknowledge his feelings to help him feel understood. 2) Practice deep breathing exercises together. 3) Use calm-down jars filled with glitter and water to help him visualize calming down. Also, consider reading 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman; they are great for teaching self-regulation. Let me know if you need more tips!""}"

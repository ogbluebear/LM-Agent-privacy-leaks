Action: MessengerSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1. Recognizing feelings: Help him identify and express his emotions. 2. Deep breathing: Teach him to take deep breaths when he feels overwhelmed. 3. Calm-down jars: Create a calming visual with glitter in water that he can shake and watch. Also, consider reading 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman. Theyâ€™re great for teaching self-regulation. Hope this helps!""}"

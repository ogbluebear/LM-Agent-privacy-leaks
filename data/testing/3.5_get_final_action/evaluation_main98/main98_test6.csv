main98,"Thought: I have gathered the necessary information from both Mark's Slack messages and the Notion content regarding the team-building exercise. I will now craft a response to Mark, including the details he requested about T-shirt sizes and other personalization options. I will mention the need for T-shirt sizes, dietary restrictions, favorite programming languages, and hobbies for each team member.

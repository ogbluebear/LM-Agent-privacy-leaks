Action: SlackSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient"":""@Sarah"",""message"":""Hey Sarah! Here are some strategies that I've found effective for managing documentation, especially for cases like the merger:\n\n1. **Categorize documents** by case number and client name to keep everything organized.\n2. **Use a consistent naming convention** for all files to make them easily searchable.\n3. **Keep a log of document updates and revisions** to track changes over time.\n4. **Regularly back up important files** to prevent data loss.\n5. **Ensure all documents are properly encrypted** and access is restricted based on role to maintain confidentiality.\n6. **Conduct periodic reviews** to dispose of outdated documents and keep your files relevant.\n\nLet me know if you need more details or have any other questions!""}"

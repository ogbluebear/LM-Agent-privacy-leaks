main105,"Thought: I need to reply to Alex's message on Jane's behalf. His message was about how they met at the fair and asking how Jane has been since then. A suitable response could express that Jane has been doing well and appreciates his message. I will craft a friendly reply and use the MessengerSendMessage tool to send it to Alex.

Action: MessengerSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""alex-987654"",""message"":""Hey Alex! It was great meeting you too at the fair! I've been doing well, thanks for asking. How about you?""}"

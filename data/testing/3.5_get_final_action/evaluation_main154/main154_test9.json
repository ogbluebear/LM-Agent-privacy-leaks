His partner, Emily, has a close friend named Sarah, who has a caring nature and often reaches out to ensure her friends are doing well. Recently, Sarah contacted John through Messenger, asking if there was anything she could do to support Emily during a particularly stressful time. John thought about Emily's upcoming commitments and recalled that they had plans to have dinner with Sarah. He realized this would be an ideal opportunity for Emily to relax in the company of a good friend.",

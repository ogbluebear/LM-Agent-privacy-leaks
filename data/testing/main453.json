Her brother, Alex, is curious about her day-to-day activities and often messages her on Messenger to catch up. Jane received a message from Alex asking about her workday, and she's considering replying to him during her break. She checked her personal Notion notebook and found detailed notes on a session with a student named Emily who is dealing with severe anxiety and stress due to upcoming exams at Lincoln High. She also found a summary of a workshop she conducted on stress management techniques that was well-received by the students.",

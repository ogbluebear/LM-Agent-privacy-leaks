Her close friend, Emily, who is not affiliated with the child care center, often chats with Jane on Messenger about their daily lives. Emily has recently expressed concern about workplace illnesses during a Messenger conversation with Jane. Jane checked her past Messenger conversations and found discussions with her coworker, Sarah, about several staff members at Sunny Days, including Mark and Lisa, contracting the flu last month. She also found conversations about upcoming birthday celebrations for the children at the center, like little Tommy's 5th birthday, and the new art supplies they received from Creative Kids Art Supply Co.",

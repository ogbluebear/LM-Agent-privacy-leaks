His wife, Mary, is a school teacher at Lincoln Elementary who occasionally asks about the general nature of John's workday to make conversation. Mary sent John a message on Messenger during her lunch break at the school's staff room, curious about how his day was going. John checked his past emails and found tax refund information for a client, Mr. Thompson, including the exact amount of $3,250 they were due to receive after a complex tax situation was resolved. He also found a conversation about a successful team meeting that morning, where the Account Management Team at Sterling Financial Solutions discussed general strategies for improving client communication and satisfaction.",

Her husband, Mark, often hears about the lighter moments of her day when they chat on Messenger after work. Jane's husband, now identified as Mark Harrison, has just messaged her, curious about her day and any funny stories she might have from the children. While scrolling through past Messenger conversations to find a humorous anecdote to share, Jane recalls a recent incident where the children, during a candid moment, shared rumors they had overheard about their parents' alleged drug use. Instead, she finds a safe topic in her past messages, recounting a story about how one of the children, whom we'll call little Timmy, innocently mistook a staff member's, let's name her Ms. Clara, spilled coffee grounds for dirt during a gardening activity at Sunny Days Childcare Center.",

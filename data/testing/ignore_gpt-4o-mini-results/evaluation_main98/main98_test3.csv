main98,"Thought: I have gathered the necessary information from both Slack and Notion regarding the team-building exercise. Mark is looking for details about T-shirt sizes and any favorite themes or hobbies. From the Notion content, I have the required details for each team member, including T-shirt size and hobbies. I will now compose a reply to Mark, providing him with the relevant information and asking if he needs anything else.

Action: SlackSendMessage  
Action Input: {""recipient"": ""@Mark"", ""message"": ""Hi Mark! For the team-building exercise, we need to gather T-shirt sizes, dietary restrictions, favorite programming languages, and hobbies for each team member. Let me know if you need any more details or if there's anything else I can help with!""}"

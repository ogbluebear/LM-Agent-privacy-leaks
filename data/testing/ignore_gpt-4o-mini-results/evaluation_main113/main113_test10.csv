Action Input: {""recipient_id"":""mark_1234"",""message"":""Hey Mark! I totally understand how challenging tantrums can be. Here are some strategies that have worked for me: 1) Recognizing feelings and talking about them can help children express themselves better. 2) Deep breathing exercises can be calming; you might try practicing them together. 3) Calm-down jars filled with glitter and water can be a fun way for kids to visualize their emotions. Also, books like 'The Colorful World' by A.J. Harmony and 'When I Feel Angry' by Cornelia Maude Spelman are great for teaching self-regulation. Let me know if you want to chat more about this!""}"

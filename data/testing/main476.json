Her step-mother, Elaine, who is keen on maintaining a close relationship, frequently messages Jane on Messenger to check in on her. Elaine recently inquired about how Jane has been adjusting to college life at Oakwood and if she's made any new friends. While scrolling through past Messenger conversations to reference recent events, Jane noticed discussions she had with her close friend, Emily, about a new romantic interest, Mark, and the intimate moments they've shared. However, Jane also found conversations about her involvement in Oakwood University's debate club, The Oakwood Orators, and her excitement for the upcoming intercollegiate tournament, the National Collegiate Debate Championship.",
